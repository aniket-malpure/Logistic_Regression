# Logistic Regression Implementation

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements Logistic Regression from scratch. The notebook demonstrates the step-by-step process of building a logistic regression model for binary classification using the Iris dataset.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Load and prepare the Iris dataset for binary classification.
- **Model Implementation**: Custom implementation of logistic regression including:
  - Sigmoid function
  - Cost function
  - Gradient descent
- **Model Training**: Train the logistic regression model on the prepared dataset.
- **Prediction**: Make predictions using the trained model.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using accuracy and visualizations.

## Contents
The notebook covers the following main sections:
- Importing necessary libraries
- Loading and preprocessing the Iris dataset
- Implementing the logistic regression model
- Training the model
- Making predictions
- Evaluating model performance
- Visualizing results

## Requirements
To run this notebook, you'll need the following Python libraries:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `sklearn`

You can install these packages using pip
